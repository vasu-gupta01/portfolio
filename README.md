# My Portfolio Website - Version 1.0

This is my first attempt at designing and building a [portfolio website](https://www.vasug.space/).

My goal here is to display any personal (or non-personal) projects that I work on. The design is super simple for now and I'm experimenting on making it more interesting in the future.

## Tech stack I used

- **Next.js** : Having had previous experience with React, I found using Next.js to be super efficient. It has some pretty cool features and makes page routing super easy.

- **Tailwindcss** : Made designing the website crazy simple and look prettyyy.
